The provided Python script demonstrates a basic example of performing mathematical calculations. 
The main() function serves as the entry point of the program. It initializes two variables, num1 and num2, with values 5 and 10, respectively. 
It then calls the calculate_sum() function, passing num1 and num2 as arguments, and stores the result in the result_sum variable. 
Similarly, it calls the calculate_product() function, passing the same arguments, and stores the result in the result_product variable. 
Finally, it prints the values of the sum and product using print().

This conditional statement ensures that the main() function is executed only if the script is run directly, not if it is imported as a module in another script.

To summarize, the script calculates the sum and product of two numbers (5 and 10) using the calculate_sum() and calculate_product() functions, respectively. 
It then prints the results.
