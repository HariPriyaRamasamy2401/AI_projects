Business Problem Description:
For this example, we will be using the breast cancer dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The objective is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features such as the radius, texture, and smoothness of the tumor. This is an importaant problem as early detection of cancer can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.

Feature Engineering and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Let's start by importing the dataset and taking a look at the first few rows.

Feature Importance: We can use the coefficients of the logistic regression model to identify which features have the strongest influence on the prediction. We can plot a bar chart to visualize the coefficients and their magnitudes. This can help us understand which features are the most important in predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

The Use of PCA for Dimensionality Reduction: To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, we can use PCA. This can help to improve the performance of the model and reduce overfitting.	

PCA Components: We can also plot a scatter plot to visualize the first two principal components of the PCA-transformed data. This can help us understand how the data is distributed and whether the classes are separable in the transformed space.


Model Comparison: Finally, we can compare the performance of the logistic regression model with and without PCA using a bar chart. This can help us understand whether PCA has improved the performance of the model.
